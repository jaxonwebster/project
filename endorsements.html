      It is a pleasure to strongly endorse Jaxon Webster. My recommendation is based upon 1 year as his Career Coach and direct beneficiary of his work as a career data analyst... Jaxon can connect the dots. He asks key questions that clarify processes. He seeks out the analytics, writes Python scripts, and leaverages SQL creating Tableau dashboards and reports that drive decisions. He is a delight to work with and knows how to build and interact with teams."
